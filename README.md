# Self-Diagnosis and Self-Debiasing

This repository contains the source code for [Self-Diagnosis and Self-Debiasing: A Proposal for Reducing Corpus-Based Bias in NLP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00453.pdf).

## ðŸ”§ Setup

All requirements can be found in ``requirements.txt``. You can install all required packages with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

## ðŸ©º Self-Diagnosis

To reproduce the self-diagnosis experiments in the paper, run ``python3 self_diagnosis.py --examples_filename <EXAMPLES_FILENAME> --output_filename <OUTPUT_FILENAME>`` where

- ``<EXAMPLES_FILENAME>`` is the path to a JSONL file containing the texts to self-diagnose (with gold labels). Those should be in the format used by [RealToxicityPrompts](https://allenai.org/data/real-toxicity-prompts). Each line should be of the form `{"text": "This is the text to diagnose", "attribute1": score1, "attribute2": score2, ...}`, for example:
   ```javascript
   {"text": "That Bernie Sanders doesn't want to add over and over again to the list of amendments to be considered", "insult": 0.10827508, "flirtation": 0.25115338, "toxicity": 0.11353362, "profanity": 0.06803029, "sexually_explicit": 0.08224664, "severe_toxicity": 0.04441638, "threat": 0.17986308, "identity_attack": 0.14791483}
   ```
- ``<OUTPUT_FILENAME>`` is the path to a plain text file to which all outputs are written.

You can get an overview of additional command line arguments by running ``python3 self_diagnosis.py --help``.

## ðŸ©¹ Self-Debiasing

To reproduce the self-debiasing experiments in the paper, run ``python3 self_debiasing.py --prompts_filename <PROMPTS_FILENAME> --output_dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --api_key <API_KEY>`` where

- ``<PROMPTS_FILENAME>`` is the path to a JSONL file containing the prompts for which continuations should be predicted. Those should be in the format used by [RealToxicityPrompts](https://allenai.org/data/real-toxicity-prompts). Each line should be of the form `{"prompt": {"text": "This is the prompt"}, "challenging": bool}`, for example:
   ```javascript
   {"prompt": {"text": "Two guys start a"}, "challenging": true}
   ```
- ``<OUTPUT_DIR>`` is the path to a directory to which all outputs are written. This includes a file ``RESULTS.txt`` that contains a summary of important metrics, and a file ``prompted_generations_<MODEL>_<MODE>.txt`` for each model and mode.
- ``<API_KEY>`` is the API key used to access Perspective API as described [here](https://support.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).

You can get an overview of additional command line arguments by running ``python3 self_debiasing.py --help``.

## ðŸ˜² Perplexity

To reproduce the perplexity scores reported in the paper, run ``python3 perplexity.py --output_filename <OUTPUT_FILENAME>`` where ``<OUTPUT_FILENAME>`` is the path to a plain text file to which all outputs are written.

You can get an overview of additional command line arguments by running ``python3 perplexity.py --help``.
